# SFND 3D Object Tracking
## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2550/view)
By completing all the lessons, you got a solid understanding of keypoint detectors, descriptors, and methods to match them between successive images. Also, I leant how to detect objects in an image using the YOLO deep-learning framework. And finally, I leant how to associate regions in a camera image with Lidar points in 3D space.

## TASKS:
### 1. Match 3D Objects
YOLO is well know Deep Learning algoirthm which can very fast produce boundingbox with live camera.
By using the YOLOv3 framework, we can extract a set of objects from a camera image that are represented by an enclosing rectangle (a "region of interest" or ROI) as well as a class label that identifies the type of object, e.g. a vehicle.

The objective of this task is to implement the method "matchBoundingBoxes", which takes as input both the previous and the current data frames and provides as output the IDs of the matched regions of interest. (i.e the boxID property)
-   Implementation overview:
1.  For each bounding ox in the current frame (currFrameBBox), iterate through all the keypoint matches.
2.  If we find a bounding box containing currFramePoint, we then consider its matched previous frame (prevFramePoint) and we try to find the associated bounding box ID (prevFrameBBOx.boxID)
3.  Store how many correspondences there are between the currFrameBBox and the PrevFrameBBox
4.  The prevFrameBBox with highest number of the keypoint correspondences is finally considered to be the best match  

``` C++ 
for (auto descr = matches.begin(); descr != matches.end(); ++descr)
  for (auto pBox = prevFrame.boundingBoxes.begin(); pBox != prevFrame.boundingBoxes.end(); ++pBox)
    if (pBox->roi.contains(prevFrame.keypoints[idxPrevious].pt) )
      for (auto cBox = currFrame.boundingBoxes.begin(); cBox != currFrame.boundingBoxes.end(); ++cBox)
        if (cBox->roi.contains(currFrame.keypoints[idxCurrent].pt))
        count.at<int>(prevBoxID,currBoxID) = count.at<int>(prevBoxID,currBoxID) + 1;
```



### 2. Compute Lidar-based TTC
```Compute the time-to-collision in second for all matched 3D objects using only Lidar measurements from the matched bounding boxes between current and previous frame```

### 3. Associate Keypoint Correspondences with Bounding Boxes
```Prepare the TTC computation based on camera measurements by associating keypoint correspondences to the bounding boxes which enclose them. All matches which satisfy this condition must be added to a vector in the respective bounding box.```

### 4. Compute Camera-based TTC
```Compute the time-to-collision in second for all matched 3D objects using only keypoint correspondences from the matched bounding boxes between current and previous frame.```

### 5. FP.5 Performance Evaluation 1
```Find examples where the TTC estimate of the Lidar sensor does not seem plausible. Describe your observations and provide a sound argumentation why you think this happened.```

### 6. FP.6 Performance Evaluation 2
```Run several detector / descriptor combinations and look at the differences in TTC estimation. Find out which methods perform best and also include several examples where camera-based TTC estimation is way off. As with Lidar, describe your observations again and also look into potential reasons.```
